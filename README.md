#Shake Gesture Detector
The Shake Gesture Detector is a web application that enables the user to change the background color of a web page with a shake gesture. The application is designed to work with devices that have an accelerometer and a mobile web browser. It uses the devicemotion event to detect the shake gesture and the device's accelerometer to determine the degree of motion.

#Installation
*Download or clone the repository from GitHub.
*Open the index.html file in a web browser on a mobile device that has an accelerometer.
*Shake the device to see the background color of the page change.
Usage
*To use the application, the user needs to open the HTML file in a mobile web browser with an accelerometer, such as a smartphone or tablet. When the user shakes the device, the background color of the page changes to a random color.
